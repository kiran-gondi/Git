    # Let's create a new mapache branch!
    git branch "new_mapache_branch"
    
    # Let's switch to (or "check out") our new branch.
    git checkout "new_mapache_branch"

    # Switch to the develop branch.
    git checkout "develop"
    
    # Merge the mapache branch into develop.
    git merge "new_mapache_branch"

    # List all branches:
    git branch
    
    # Rename a branch:
    git branch -m "old_mapache_branch" "new_mapache_branch"
    
    # Delete a local mapache branch:
    git branch -d "mapache_branch_to_delete"
    
    # Delete a remote mapache branch:
    git branch -d -r "remote_mapache_branch_to_delete"

    # Create a new branch and switch to it at the same time:
    git checkout -b "another_mapache_branch"

    # Fetch a remote branch from the origin server (remote repository)
    git fetch origin "remote_mapache_branch"

    # Checkout a remote branch as a local branch using a "tracking branch"
    git checkout -b "local_mapache_branch" origin/"remote_mapache_branch"

    # Push your local branch to origin (the remote repository)
    git push origin "local_mapache_branch"

    # As a "tracking branch" this will update origin/"remote_mapache_branch"

    # prune branches
    git fetch --prune

    #I also want to share a “safe way to show the delete commands only for local branches merged into master with the last commit over a month ago”:

    for k in $(git branch --format="%(refname:short)" --merged master); do 
      if (($(git log -1 --since='1 month ago' -s $k|wc -l)==0)); then
        echo git branch -d $k
      fi
    done

    #Since the command only echos (prints to the screen) the git branch -d commands, it’s a safe way to preview the commands before running them.
    #A commenter named Asaf Pinhassi pointed out that you can add -r to this command to list the remote branches, which is a good tip to add here!
